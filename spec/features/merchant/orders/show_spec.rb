# As a merchant employee
# When I visit an order show page from my dashboard
# I see the recipients name and address that was used to create this order
# I only see the items in the order that are being purchased from my merchant
# I do not see any items in the order being purchased from other merchants
# For each item, I see the following information:
# - the name of the item, which is a link to my item's show page
# - an image of the item
# - my price for the item
# - the quantity the user wants to purchase
